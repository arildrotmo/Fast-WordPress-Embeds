# UNFINISHED AND UNTESTED

This plugin will discover your embedded videos from YouTube and Vimeo, and replace them with a clickable thumbnail and a play button. Does NOT depend on jQuery. Also works without Javascript, the thumbnail is then an external link to the video. Uses <img sizes/srcset> for responsive images.

## Installation

Install from WordPress "Plugins|Add New" screen, or manually:

1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Fast WordPress Embeds and enable the video embeds you want to load fast.

## Frequently Asked Questions

# What does the plugin do?

It replaces the WordPress-generated embed code with just the video thumbnail and a play button. This will load much faster than the original embed. The embed is loaded and autoplays when the user clicks the play button.

# Will this work on my blog/page?

This is a very simple plugin, so it should! But if you encounter problems : Try disabling embeds in Settings -> Fast WordPress Embeds. If that doesnt work you can just deactivate the plugin, and your embeds will load as normal. Shoot me a message as well, and describe your problem, and I'll try to fix it.
